# Somethings to remember about VM Fusion Player:

# Port Forwarding:

Using NAT connection you can specific port forwards in the nat.conf file:
For example when running wireguard(on a VM, not the host) you'll want to ensure that all UDP traffic from port 51820 is forwarded to the VM
[incomingudp]
51820 = 172.16.254.132:51820

Finding the file can be tricky....try:
/Library/Preferences/VMware FUsion/vmnet8 (note that this means the forwarding rules will be applied to all the vms)
(vmnet8 is the interface corresponding to NAT connection)
